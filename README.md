Technology Stack
This app is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, which is a popular and powerful combination of technologies for developing web applications.

MongoDB: The app utilizes MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database, for storing user account information and task data securely.

Express.js: The backend of the app is powered by Express.js, a flexible and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js handles routing, middleware, and other server-side functionalities.

React.js: The frontend of the app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js provides a fast and interactive user experience, allowing seamless task management.

Node.js: The app runs on Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js enables the app to handle server-side operations, interact with the database, and provide real-time updates to the user interface.
